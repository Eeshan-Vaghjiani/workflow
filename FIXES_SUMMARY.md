# Summary of Implemented Fixes

## 1. Calendar Task Update 422 Error (Fixed Previously)

- Fixed the problem where the UI would "snap back" after dragging events by adding proper state management
- Added a `formatTaskForCalendar` helper function to properly format backend task data
- Updated the state update logic to maintain the calendar state with server-side data
- Added thorough error handling for different scenarios

## 2. Google Calendar Integration 500 Error (Fixed Today)

### Issue: The application was failing with a 500 error due to missing Google Calendar ID

We implemented a complete solution by:

1. **Database Updates**

    - Created migration `add_google_calendar_id_to_google_calendars_table` to add a `calendar_id` field
    - Created migration `add_google_calendar_id_to_users_table` as a backup option
    - Added `calendar_id` to the fillable fields in the `GoogleCalendar` model

2. **Backend API**

    - Added a new endpoint for saving Google Calendar settings (`/calendar/settings` POST route)
    - Created the `saveSettings` method in `GoogleAuthController` for processing the data
    - Enhanced `CalendarController->sync()` to validate and properly use the calendar ID
    - Improved error handling with specific error codes for different failure types

3. **Frontend User Interface**

    - Updated the Calendar Settings page to include a form for entering and saving the Calendar ID
    - Added comprehensive input validation and error handling
    - Improved the UX flow for setting up Google Calendar integration

4. **Documentation**
    - Created a guide (`GOOGLE_CALENDAR_SETUP_GUIDE.md`) explaining how to properly use the Calendar ID feature
    - Documented common error codes and their solutions
    - Added instructions for finding and using Google Calendar IDs

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Test the Google Calendar integration with various calendar types:

    - Primary calendar (`primary`)
    - Secondary calendars (using the full calendar ID)
    - Calendars shared with limited permissions

2. **User Education**: Make sure users understand they need to:

    1. Connect their Google account first
    2. Enter a valid Calendar ID
    3. Use the correct ID format from Google Calendar's settings

3. **Monitoring**: Watch for any new error patterns that might emerge and address them as needed
