# Google Calendar Integration Guide

## Overview

This guide will help you set up the Google Calendar integration correctly in your workflow application. We've made two important changes:

1. Added a **Calendar ID field** to the Settings page
2. Improved error handling to better identify integration issues

## Initial Setup

### Step 1: Connect Your Google Account

1. Go to **Calendar Settings** (/calendar/settings)
2. Click the "Connect Google Calendar" button
3. Follow the Google authorization flow
4. Allow all requested permissions

### Step 2: Set Your Calendar ID

After connecting your Google account, you need to specify which calendar to use for syncing:

1. Go to your Google Calendar at https://calendar.google.com/
2. Find the calendar you want to use in the left sidebar
3. Click on the three dots (â‹®) next to your calendar
4. Select "Settings and sharing"
5. Scroll down to the "Integrate calendar" section
6. Copy your **Calendar ID** (it looks like: `primary` or `something@group.calendar.google.com`)
7. Return to the Calendar Settings page in your workflow application
8. Paste this ID in the "Google Calendar ID" field
9. Click "Save Calendar ID"

## Using Your Primary Calendar

If you want to use your main Google Calendar, you can simply enter `primary` in the Calendar ID field.
