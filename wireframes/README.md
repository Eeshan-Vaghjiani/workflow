# Workflow Management System Wireframes

This folder contains HTML/CSS wireframes for a workflow management application.

## Getting Started

1. Extract all files from the ZIP archive, maintaining the folder structure
2. Open any of the HTML files in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari)
3. Navigate between wireframes using the sidebar navigation

## File Structure

- `styles.css` - Main stylesheet for the application
- `calendar-styles.css` - Dedicated stylesheet for the calendar view
- Various HTML files representing different pages of the application

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any styling issues:

1. Make sure all CSS files are in the same directory as the HTML files
2. Try using the `test-css.html` file to verify that CSS is loading correctly
3. If the calendar view looks broken, ensure both `styles.css` and `calendar-styles.css` are linked in the HTML

## Browser Compatibility

These wireframes are designed to work in modern browsers. For best results, use:

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Edge 90+
- Safari 14+

## Notes

- These are static wireframes for demonstration purposes only
- Interactive elements (buttons, links) are not functional except for navigation
- The wireframes demonstrate the UI layout and design, not actual functionality
