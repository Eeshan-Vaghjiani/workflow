# Simplified Wireframes

This folder contains simplified wireframe mockups for the workflow management application. These wireframes are designed to be minimal and focus on layout and functionality rather than visual design.

## Wireframe Files

- `styles.css` - Basic CSS for wireframe styling
- `user-dashboard.html` - Main dashboard view for users
- `calendar-view.html` - Calendar view with month display
- `tasks.html` - Task management interface
- `ai-tasks.html` - AI-powered task assistance

## Design Principles

1. **Simplicity** - Wireframes use only basic shapes and minimal styling
2. **Clarity** - Layout and functionality are clearly indicated
3. **Consistency** - Common elements are styled consistently across pages

## Usage

1. Open any HTML file in a web browser to view the wireframe
2. Navigate between wireframes by clicking on the sidebar navigation items (note: navigation is not functional in these wireframes)

## Notes

- These wireframes represent the basic structure and layout only
- Actual implementation will require additional styling and functionality
- Interactive elements are not functional in these wireframes
